About: 

Deepfakes are images or videos that have been modified to changes their faces or other parts of the image to change the
subject. Usually, the faces of one person are replaced by another. This deepfake generation is done primarily via Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). This makes the deepfake have certain characteristics that are unique to the generation process
through which they can be detected. This type of modification has a great capacity for producing fraudulent media which can be
used to cause confusion and harm. Therefore, a method for the detection of deepfakes is of the utmost urgency. As deepfake
technology becomes more and more advanced, detection methods need to keep up. In this paper, we present a survey and review of
the most recent deepfake detection methods in order to facilitate any further research in the domain. Each technique has been
carefully described and their accuracy on different common deepfake datasets has been described. This should provide a starting
point for anyone wishing to perform further research on any of these techniques or come up with one on their own.
