Abstract: 
Artificial Intelligence occupies a major part in the end-to-end technology we use every day. In order to ensure and enhance security, Artificial Intelligence techniques are used in cyber security applications. Many of the cyber security applications including DDoS security, web firewall, antivirus, and antimalware are attacked everyday by various means by the attackers. As a result, we need an algorithm or a system that learns from the existing attacks and detect intrusions in the mere future of the same pattern. Artificial Intelligence helps to prevent breaches of a sensitive organization and customer data. Artificial Intelligence techniques help in early detection of threats. The use of Artificial Intelligence in cyber security applications helps analyze the traffic in a network, and fast incident response schemes can be applied in order to prevent the attack to happen. The main objective of this chapter is to analyze the uses of Artificial Intelligence techniques in various cyber security applications in order to achieve safe transactions between the users.
